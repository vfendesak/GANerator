# GANerator

An MVP for applying Machine Learning (ML) in the credit risk modeling lifecycle. 


It currently contains two types of models:

1. ðŸŽ¯ **Credit Stress Predictor**
  - ML Method: Random Forest - A machine learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to create a singular, more accurate result.
2. ðŸ”„ **Data Synthesizer**
  - ML Method: GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) - A deep learning method in which two neural networks compete with each other in a game, learning to generate new data with the same statistics as the training set



## Installation

[![PyTorch](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=pytorch)](https://pytorch.org/)
[![SkLearn](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=sklearn)](https://scikit-learn.org/)
[![Python](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py)](https://python.org/)

Create a new virtual environment (venv) and activate it:

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

Install requirements and the repo itself:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -e .

Download the [Training Data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/data?select=application_train.csv) and store the files _application_test.csv_ and _application_train.csv_ in the [/data](/data) directory.


## Usage

1. **Credit Stress Predictor** - Run the [Risk Modelling Notebook](notebooks/risk_modelling.ipynb).

2. **Data Synthesizer** - Run the [Data Synthesizer Notebook](notebooks/data_synthesizer.ipynb).
